# Degree Profile Graph Matching

Degree profile algorithm for graph matching 

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the graph matching method developed in "Efficient random graph matching via degree profiles" (2018) by Jian Ding, Zongming Ma, Yihong Wu, and Jiaming Xu. The arXiv preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07821.

**DP_comparison** folder contains the code to compare Degree Profile with the existing graph matching methods.

**Slashdot** folder contains the code to evaluate the performance of Degree Profile on matching Slashdot networks.

**matching_deg_pro_wigner.m** contains the matlab code of the degree profile algorithm for matching weighted graphs.

**matching_deg_pro.m** contains the matlab code of the degree profile algorithm for matching unweighted graphs.

**dwass_discrete2.m** contains the subroutine of computing the W1 Wasserstein distance between two discerete distributions.
