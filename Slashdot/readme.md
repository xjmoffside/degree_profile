This folder contains the code to evaluate the performance of Degree Profile method on matching two randomly subsampled Slashdot networks.

The Slashdot network contains links between the users of Slashdot (a technology-related news website). The network was obtained in
February 2009 and is available on Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection (SNAP) https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Slashdot0902.html.

**SD0811.txt** contains the Slashdot network dataset.

**SlashDotRep.m** contains the code for comparing the performance of Degree Profile with that of quadratic programming and EigenAlign. 

**quadprog_admm** contains the ADMM implementation of the quadratic programming method for graph matching.

**spectral_init.m** contains the code for aligning the leading eigenvectors of two matrices.
