This folder contains the code to compare the Degree Profile mathod with two existing graph matching methods: EigenAlign and Quadratic Programming. 
More comparisons can be found at https://github.com/xjmoffside/grampa. See Section 5 in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07821.pdf for details.

**ER_comparison.m** contains the code for matching ER random graphs. 

**Wigner_comparison.m** contains the code for matching Gaussian Wigner random matrices. 

The codes for EigenAlign and Quadratic Programming can be found in the "Slashdot" folder.
